**BlackJack-Card Game**: This project has the following requirements. To know more about this game, go to the link (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack)

1. The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
2. The player can stand or hit.
3. The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
4. You need to keep track of the player's total money.
5. You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...

In this project, I have used object oriented programming (OOP) and classes to create a complete BlackJack (BlackJack) card game in Python. The following are four classes whcih are generated to develope a BlackJack card game. 
- Class Card
- Class Deck
- Class Player
- Class Dealer
- Class Chip

**Tic Tac Toe Game**: The requirements for this project are the following.

1. Two players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer)
2. The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move.
3. You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board

In this project, I wrote a function "play_tictactoe_game" which contains five function (given below), to develope a Tic Tac Toe game using Python. You can find details of this game here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

- display_board
- user_input_payer1
- user_input_payer2
- replacement_X_player
- replacement_O_player
- win_check
- ask_player()
